# Introduction
A startup called Sales_Rocket wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on their sales across the nation. 
Management has a few questions they’d like easy access to. Currently, they answer these questions through spreadsheets 
scattered about and a variety of different tools. Unfortunately, none of the spreadsheets and tools neatly combine all their answers into one.

They would like a dashboard designer to go through each question and try to come up with a way to display their data in a way that is neat and intuitive, even for the less data-savvy among them.

# Project Overview
This project focuses on designing a dashboard prototype with the end-user in mind. Using the Superstore dataset and a modern dashboarding tool (Tableau in my case), I built a prototype that allows users to intuitively explore the data and answer a set of key business questions.

The process involved:

* Identifying the audience and their needs.

* Translating those needs into clear, actionable questions.

* Designing a dashboard layout that makes insights easy to find.

* Implementing the dashboard using Tableau and validating that it supports intuitive analysis.

## Questions:
1) Q1.What is the most profitable City in the State of Tennessee?
2) Q2. What’s the average annual profit for that city across all years in that city?
3) Q3.What’s the most profitable product category in Iowa?
4) Q4.What is the most popular product in that category in 2016?
5) Q5.What was the most profitable month in 2018 overall?
6) Q6.How widely did monthly profits vary in 2018?
