# Introduction
A startup called Sales_Rocket wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on their sales across the nation. 
Management has a few questions theyâ€™d like easy access to. Currently, they answer these questions through spreadsheets 
scattered about and a variety of different tools. Unfortunately, none of the spreadsheets and tools neatly combine all their answers into one.

They would like a dashboard designer to go through each question and try to come up with a way to display their data in a way that is neat and intuitive, even for the less data-savvy among them.

# Project Overview
This project focuses on designing a dashboard prototype with the end-user in mind. Using the Superstore dataset and a modern dashboarding tool (Tableau in my case), I built a prototype that allows users to intuitively explore the data and answer a set of key business questions.

The process involved:

* Identifying the audience and their needs.

* Translating those needs into clear, actionable questions.

* Designing a dashboard layout that makes insights easy to find.

* Implementing the dashboard using Tableau and validating that it supports intuitive analysis.
